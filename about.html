        <p>
            Join me on my journey to learn software development. I have always been intrigued with how little lines of code are used to solve real world problems.
            <br> When I am not coding, I enjoy playing football. I am born Manchester United fan *wooop woop*. <br> My goal is to use my programming knowledge to solve energy related problems in Africa.
